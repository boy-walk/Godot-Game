Hello cool person.

This is a sample game to get to know Godot. It will be a wave based shooter, with roguelike elements.

To start working on the game, all you have to do is install the latest version of Godot, and then import the project from this repo.

There's a linear board with a list of to-dos, but feel free to put up a PR with anything you want to make!
